interlocking of points and signals
In the 1881 Railways Act the board of trade had powers to compel railways to have interlocking between pointwork and signals
The idea was to improve safety by preventing conflicting moves being signalled.
While the safety issue is not a great concern with models I would suggest most of would prefer to avoid collisions.
It also appeals to me to operate in a prototypical manner
The railways adopted a scheme where they used levers to operate points and signals. The interlocking was provided by a mechanical frame. Operating levers would mechanically lock or release others preventing their movement.
It is possible to do the same on a model layout. However I lack the skills to do this. 
I am therefore using the common system of having switches to operate the points and signals
The switches can be operated by a lever frame, a simple row of switches or on a mimic diagram.
It is also intended that the devices can be worked by servos or other point motors, or be LEDs.
